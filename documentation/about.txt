INTRODUCTION
------------
	Google Drive is Google's method for cloud storage. Too bad it isn't
	natively supporting Linux for now. Grive is the community-based
	project to get your Google Drive synchronized with Linux.
	
	Grive has no graphical user interface, and that is where grive-gtk
	steps up to the task. A new icon will be added to your system tray
	which will have a popup menu to sync your drive.
	
	Installation of the project is done by copying some files manually
	to your file system, after which grive-gtk should work like a charm.
	Read the 'documentation/installation.txt' file for further
	instructions.

FUTURE FEATURES
---------------
	In a future version I will be adding some additional options, such
	as scheduled synchronization and an interactive system-tray icon.
