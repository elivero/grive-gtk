INTRODUCTION
------------
grive-gtk aims to be a graphical implementation for the grive project.
This project aims to be an open-source implementation of Google Drive
for Linux-based operating systems. A folder will be synchronised with 
your Google Drive automatically. Furthermore, a tray icon is added to 
give you more control over grive.


UNDER DEVELOPMENT
-----------------
Previous versions introduced automatic synchronisation. This feature
will be rewritten for this version. 

Further modifications are made to create more stability and usability.
A new feature related to this is for instance 'automatic resync on
failure'.
