CONTINUED?
----------

Apparently Bas Dalenoord hasn't got time to deal with this project. Works
pretty well as is, and as I use it and know a thing or two about C and GTK,
I will, if I find the time, hack on it to even out some rough spots, and
then who knows, maybe even incorporate grive within it as a single executable.

So far this repo is a verbatim copy of bdalenoord/grive-gtk and as far as this
line here is present, it means I'm a lazy slob.

directory of this repository.

INTRODUCTION
------------
grive-gtk aims to be a graphical implementation for the grive project.
This project aims to be an open-source implementation of Google Drive
for Linux-based operating systems. A folder will be synchronised with 
your Google Drive automatically. Furthermore, a tray icon is added to 
give you more control over grive.


UNDER DEVELOPMENT
-----------------
Previous versions introduced automatic synchronisation. This feature
has been rewritten for this version.

Further modifications are made to create more stability and usability.
A new feature related to this is for instance 'automatic resync on
failure'.
