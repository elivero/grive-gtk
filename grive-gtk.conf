# GRIVE DIRECTORY
#
# When you installed grive you created a directory which is kept in sync
# with Google Drive. The path to this directory must be defined below
# to make grive-gtk function properly. Otherwise, grive-gtk will try
# and sync a default location (/home/USERNAME/grive) which might fail.
#
#GRIVE_DIRECTORY = /path/to/synced/directory

# CUSTOM ICON
#
# It is possible to define a custom icon to be used by grive-gtk. To do
# so, uncomment and modify the option below.
#
#CUSTOM_ICON=/path/to/icon

# SYNCHRONISATION TIMEOUT
#
# A custom synchronisation timeout may be defined below. The default
# timeout is 600 seconds, which is 10 minutes.
#
#SYNC_TIMEOUT=600

# AUTOMATIC RESYNC (WARNING: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
#
# If grive endures an error, automatic resync can be enabled by uncommenting
# the value below...
# 
# The second value is optional to determine how many times the application
# should retry before giving up. The default is 3 retries, meaning that
# the sync process will be initiated four times max in total.
#
#SYNC_AUTO_RETRY=true
#SYNC_AUTO_RETRY_TIMES=3
